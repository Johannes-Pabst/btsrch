# btsrch
a cross-platform search bar that opens with a keyboard shortcut, lets you type something and shows results which can be selected with arrow keys and executed with enter.
## Features

- Instant search UI (opens via keyboard shortcut)
- Unit-aware calculator (supports mixed units and conversions)
- Link detection and browser launching
- File/folder path opening
- Unicode & emoji search with images
- Custom shortcuts via scripts directory
- Works on Windows, X11, and Wayland natively
- Extend functionality by adding Rust modules and recompiling
- extensive configuration possibilities

### Features exclusive to specific OS / linux DE / tool
- on linux, searched apps show icons according to the freedesktop standard
- on linux, pasting in a command offers to run it on the standard terminal emulator
- when using [cliphist](https://github.com/sentriz/cliphist/tree/master), searching and recopying old clipboard entries is supported. No image previews yet, though.

## capabilities
### unit calculator
a calculator that parses the search input as a calculation and outputs the result, ready to copy with enter.
#### example:
`987654321/123456789`
evaluates to:
`8.0000000729`

`1m+3yards as in`
evaluates to:
`147.37008 inches`

`(13mA*4V*1h)/(12u*0.7mmol+2mg)/(9.81m/s²) as mi`
evaluates to:
`1140.13063 miles`

### custom shortcuts
create a directory `scripts` in the root of the cloned repository and add your shortcuts to make their file names searchable. Press enter to open / execute the selected shortcut.
#### supported file formats
##### linux
- `.sh`
- `.url`
##### windows
- `.exe`
- `.ps1`
- `.bat`
- `.lnk`
- `.url`

especially for windows, there are probably more supported formats since everything btsrch doesn't recognize gets passed to the `open` crate.
### links
paste a link in the search bar and it'll offer to open it in your standard browser. Only the most common top level domains are supported. If you want another to also work, like e.g. `.ai`, add it to the list in `src/link_parser.rs`.

If a link with a supported top level domain doesn't work, please create an issue on github.

example working link: `github.com/Johannes-Pabst/btsrch/`
### paths
paste a path to a folder or file to open it in the default application for that file type / the file manager.
### unicode / emoji
search a unicode character's / emoji's name to get offered to copy that character.

Since egui doesn't support colored characters, btsrch also shows an image for each emoji from the same json file.


## Installation
first, clone the github repository where you want the programm installation. (portable btw!)

to do this, run `git clone https://github.com/Johannes-Pabst/btsrch.git` in the right folder.

If you don't have git installed, you can also download the zip from github ([https://github.com/Johannes-Pabst/btsrch/archive/refs/heads/master.zip](https://github.com/Johannes-Pabst/btsrch/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)) and extract it where you want it.

next, you'll want to install rust to compile the repository from source.

To install rust, follow the instructions on [https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/).

to compile the programm, run `cargo build --release` in the repo's root directory.

Now, the only thing left is to make it auto-run on a specific shortcut. This differs based on the OS.
### Windows
the easiest method I found is using autohotkey. There is already a .exe file in the root directory called `btsrch.exe`. This file was created by compiling `btsrch.ahk` with autohotkey for windows. If you don't have autohotkey installed, you can simply add this file to autostart and every time you press alt + space the search bar should open.

If you don't want to run a random .exe file from the internet, install autohotkey and add btsrch.ahk to autostart instead.
### Linux
Since this is linux, there are lots of different ways to achieve this. Your desktop manager might have an auto-installed app for managing hotkeys like cinnamon's `cinnamon-settings-keyboard` app. If not, You can install and use `sxhkd`. Here's a config file that runs btsrch on alt + space:
```
alt + space
    /path/to/btsrch/repo/btsrch.sh
```
after adding this to your config file at `~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc`, you'll have to make sxhkd start at boot. Then, everything should work. If it doesn't, feel free to post an issue with a detailed error message.

## configuration
a file `config.toml` should be created in the repo root in order to configure how the search bar looks, how big it is, the priority of specific search result providers and how they find their results can be configured. The standard visual configuration is intentionally minimal in order to make it easy for users to select their preferred look themselves. Sample configuration files can be found in `reporoot/sample_configs`. In case a whole entry is missing from config.toml, running btsrch will inform you and suggest some default values ready to copy to your config.

### Troubleshooting
- on cinnamon 6.6+, btsrch might not gain focus when opened. As a workaround, the following command can be used in the cinnamon shortcut manager to start btsrch and then give it focus using xdotool: `bash -c "/path/to/btsrch/repo/btsrch.sh & xdotool search --sync --name "^BTSRCH$" windowactivate"`
- desktop apps with `Terminal = true` in their .desktop files like htop and entered commands need to be launched in a terminal. finding the standard terminal emulator in any linux DE unfortunately is far from trivial. btsrch should manage to find it in gnome and cinnamon. In case it doesn't find a standard terminal emulator, the easiest way to help it out is to set the TERMINAL environment variable to your emulator. In case it still doesn't work, please open an issue on github.
